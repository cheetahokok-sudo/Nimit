/// THEY ARE NOT DECORATION. Reviewers open the privacy link from inside the
/// app; a dead one is a rejection, and a build that carries a dead one to
/// TestFlight has already shown it to real testers. So the test refuses to
/// pass while either is still the placeholder below. That is deliberate: the
